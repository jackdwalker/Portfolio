            <div class="content-text">Hi. I'm Jack. I'm currently studying to be a full-stack web developer 
                at Coder Academy in Brisbane, Australia. I currently have experience in Ruby, HTML5, and 
                CSS (including Sass). By the end of the 25 week bootcamp I will have also learnt to utilise
                Ruby on Rails and the MERN stack. I'm super excited apply my skills to develop unique and 
                innovative, yet simple solutions to everyday problems.</div>

                I'm deeply interested in cybersecurity, and its role in the tech industry. It is set to play
                a pivotal role as we move forward in the coming years. Getting my feet wet in cybersecurity
                has been an overwhelming experience to say the least. The diversity of the field is so exciting
                to me, it holds a potential lifetime's worth of learning. In my spare time I've been participating
                extensively in CTFs and teaching myself the basics of pentesting with tools like Nmap, Metasploit,
                Wireshark, and Burpsuite in a Kali Linux environment.

            <div class="content-text"> Fashion has played an influential role in my upbringing 
                and is the form of art I connect with the most. I try to stay up to date with what's 
                trending, mostly in streetwear, but I have a strong appreciation for high fashion too.
                Some may argue my classification of fashion as art, but I believe that for many people 
                it is one of the purest creative expressions of their personality, worn on a daily basis. 
                The cohesiveness of an outfit is in its colours, textures, materials, and individual fits,
                just as a painting's is its subject, stroke style, surface, and colour choice.</div>

            <div class="content-text"> I am also passionate about music as both a listener and a creator.
                I started producing electronic music early 2016 and had a small stint DJing around Brisbane 
                with my best friend around the same time. I still spend time here and there playing around
                in Ableton, primarily just as a creative outlet. I'll listen to just about anything but just
                to give you an idea - while the list is endless - some of my biggest influencers are electronic 
                artists like Gesaffelstein, Porter Robinson, Asdek, JUSTICE and Disclosure.</div>

            <div class="content-text">My first experience with gaming was sitting on my Dad's lap watching him
                play MMORPGs. He would wake me up in the morning and tell me all about what had happened after I
                had been sent to bed. Eventually when I was around 9 or 10, I was given my first computer.
                I quickly found myself within the competitive gaming scene. I played Counter-Strike at a high level
                until other things took a higher priority in my life. I still spend a large portion of my spare time
                playing games recreationally.

                anime fan. I spent 6 months living on the ski fields in Niseko working in a hotel and skiing every spare
                second I got. The next skiing holiday is never close enough.</div>
