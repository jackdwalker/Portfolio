## My Website 

### Purpose
The purpose of developing this website was three-fold. Primarily it was made as an assessment piece, showcasing what I had learnt about HTML and CSS, and how I could apply those lessons. Secondly it was created to display my skills, work history, and a little bit about myself to potential employers and anyone else what was interested. Thirdly it was a fun exercise in engaging creative process and infusing a bit of myself in the code I was creating.

### Functionality/Features
The website features a responsive mobile-up design, scaling nicely from widths of 320px right through to 2880px. It features easily identifiable (at least I think - but this is a matter of opinion) anchors allowing intuitive site navigation, with smooth scrolling. I wanted to make the site fun to play with and move around, so I implemented a touch of JavaScript (JS) to allow my content panels to slide in and out. When minimised the content panels take little screen real-estate, allowing users to have a better view of the art I used on my website. I also used JS to create a back to top button that will only display itself after the user has scrolled past the page they load on to. Finally I implemented a contact form that will at some stage utilise a PHP or SQL database as a way to store messages. This felt like a safer way to allow users to contact me. I wasn't comfortable openly displaying my email on a public website for security reasons.    I used SCSS to style my website in a way that represented me, and in a way that I personally think looks really appealing and fun to navigate. Plus there's the little glowy boys on my front page that will glow when you mouse over them :D
