## My Website 

### Purpose
The purpose of developing this website was three-fold. Primarily it was made as an assessment piece, showcasing what I had learnt about HTML and CSS, and how I could apply those lessons. Secondly it was created to display my skills, work history, and a little bit about myself. Thirdly it was a fun exercise in engaging creative process and infusing a bit of myself in the code I was creating.
