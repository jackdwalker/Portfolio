## My Website 

### Purpose
The purpose of developing this website was three-fold. Primarily it was made as an assessment piece, showcasing what I had learnt about HTML and CSS, and how I could apply those lessons. Secondly it was created to display my skills, work history, and a little bit about myself to potential employers and anyone else what was interested. Thirdly it was a fun exercise in engaging creative process and infusing a bit of myself in the code I was creating.

### Functionality/Features
The website features a responsive mobile-up design, scaling nicely from widths of 320px right through to 2880px. It features easily identifiable (at least I think - but this is a matter of opinion) anchors allowing intuitive site navigation, with smooth scrolling. I wanted to make the site fun to play with and move around, so I implemented a touch of JavaScript (JS) to allow my content panels to slide in and out. When minimised the content panels take little screen real-estate, allowing users to have a better view of the art I used on my website. I also used JS to create a back to top button that will only display itself after the user has scrolled past the page they load on to. Finally I implemented a contact form that will at some stage utilise a PHP or SQL database as a way to store messages. This felt like a safer way to allow users to contact me. I wasn't comfortable openly displaying my email on a public website for security reasons. I used SCSS to style my website in a way that represented me, and in a way that I personally think looks really appealing and fun to navigate. Plus there's the little glowy boys on my front page that will glow when you mouse over them :D

### Sitemap
I used a single page design with multiple internal anchors to navigate to my page's contents, and external links to other places users can find me on the Internet.

Tablet format is just the same as desktop but with some small formatting changes to font size for readability.


### Target Audience
This project was first and foremost designed to appeal to potential future employers, other software developers and colleagues, and give them an idea of who I was, and what skills I possess, presenting a bit of my personality in the process. I also wanted to build a page that could showcase what I had learnt so far at the Coder Academy bootcamp to my friends and family. Finally I wanted a website that would strike interest in people who had accidentally navigated to my page, and engage them for at least a little while before they returned to searching for the original page that they were looking for - who knows who might stumble upon your page.

### Tech Stack
The base for my website was built using HTML5 and I styled it using CSS compiled from SCSS. I called the Google Fonts API to use my font choice, 'Work Sans', and the Font Awesome CDN to utilise some groovy little icons throughout my website.

In the future I plan to implement a PHP database in the back-end so that I can take messages from my contact form. I will hopefully also convert my website to Ruby on Rails in the near future as this content is covered in my course!

## Design Documentation

### Moodboard
Up until around a year ago my best friend and I were reblogging posts on Tumblr for a music project which formed somewhat of a moodboard for all of the things that interest us. We shared a very similar taste, so I used that Tumblr page to inspire my website design colour palette, style, and art direction.

### The Design Process

Honestly my design process was pretty awful, and it's shown in how messy my workflow has been for this project.

I came in with a bit of background in HTML/CSS and so I started working on my portfolio project from the beginning of HTML/CSS portion of the course. 

### Wireframes

### Personal Logo

### Usability Considerations
Accessibility
Performance

### Challenges
Changed header format to be the same across all versions because of issues with nav responsiveness and a lack of time to fix it and get everything else done


## Details of Planning Process

## Short Answer Q & A:

### 1. Describe key events that led to the development of the internet from the 1980s to today
### 2. Define and describe the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers
### 3. Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today
